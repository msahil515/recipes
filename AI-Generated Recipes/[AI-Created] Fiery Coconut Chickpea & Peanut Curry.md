- Remove from heat and stir in the juice of 2 lime wedges
- Season with salt and pepper to taste

#### 5. Serve your dish

### CHEF'S TIP:
For the full fiery experience, don't discard the seeds from the Thai chiles. If you're sensitive to handling hot peppers, wear gloves when chopping them and avoid touching your eyes.
